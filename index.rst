The Penetration Testing Execution Standard v2.0
###############################################

.. warning::
	The v2.0 represents an updated version of the initial release of PTES from 2011 and includes the knowledge and learnings from hundreds of successful penetration tests along the way.
	This version is however still under active development. The original, but outdated standard can be found at `<http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/Main_Page>`_.

The penetration testing execution standard consists of seven (7) main sections. These cover everything related to a penetration test - from the initial communication and reasoning behind a penetration test, through the intelligence gathering and threat modeling phases where testers are working behind the scenes in order to get a better understanding of the
tested organization, through vulnerability research, exploitation and post exploitation, where the technical security expertise of the testers come to play and combine with the business understanding of the engagement, and finally to the reporting, which captures the entire process, in a manner that makes sense to the customer and provides the most value to it.

Following are the main sections defined by the standard as the basis for penetration testing execution:

#. :ref:`preengagement_interactions`
#. :ref:`intelligence_gathering`
#. :ref:`threat_modeling`
#. :ref:`vulnerability_analysis`
#. :ref:`exploitation`
#. :ref:`post_exploitation`
#. :ref:`reporting`

The standard does not provide any technical guidelines regarding how to execute an actual penetration test on purpose as such guidelines always must be tailored to a specific scope. Such guidance can for example be found within the following resources:

- `OWASP Web Security Testing Guide <https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/>`__
- `OWASP Mobile Application Security Testing Guide <https://mas.owasp.org/MASTG/>`__
- `OWASP IoT Security Verification Standard <https://github.com/OWASP/IoT-Security-Verification-Standard-ISVS>`__
- `OWASP Cheat Sheet Series <https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/index.html>`__
- `CIS Benchmark <https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks>`__
- `Red Team Notes <https://www.ired.team/>`__
