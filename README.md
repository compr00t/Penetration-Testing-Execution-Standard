## Why?

The [pentest-standard.org](http://pentest-standard.org) site or its [fork](https://github.com/pentest-standard/docs) is great, but both are a little dated.

## Is this official?

No. This is currently an unofficial fork that can be found at [pentest-standard.com](http://pentest-standard.com)

## Original

The original material comes from [pentest-standard.org](http://pentest-standard.org) and it's [fork](https://github.com/pentest-standard/docs).
